## 🌐 Overview

**TechMarket** is a complete e-commerce solution tailored for consumer electronics. It covers the full shopping lifecycle — from browsing a multi-category catalog with rich filtering, to checkout via Stripe, to order history and receipt delivery. The platform also includes a proprietary analytics system that tracks user sessions, behavioral events, geography, and device data, enabling product and business insights out of the box.

The backend is a **Django REST Framework** API deployed with **Gunicorn** + **Docker** on Render, backed by a **PostgreSQL** database. The frontend is a **React 19 + TypeScript** SPA built with Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS.

## ⚙️ Backend

### Apps & Modules

The backend is organized as a set of focused Django apps, each responsible for a clear domain:

| App | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `market` | Product catalog, orders, signboards, product series |
| `user` | Custom User model with Cloudinary avatar, JWT auth flows |
| `payments` | Stripe Checkout session creation, webhook event handling |
| `analytics` | Session fingerprinting, behavioral event logging |
| `techmarketAPI` | Settings split, custom middleware, global permissions |

---

### Data Models

#### Product System

The `Product` model stores name, category (choices: `LAPTOP`, `PC`, `NETWORK_DEVICE`, `PRINTER_SCANNER`, `PC_PART`, `OTHER`), series (FK), pricing (`original_price` / `sale_price`), stock, structured `characteristics` (JSONField), color variants stored as a PostgreSQL `ArrayField`, and CSS3 color validation enforced at the model level.

Color variants use a clever naming convention: `ProductName__COLOR`, allowing a single product to exist as multiple DB rows (one per color) while the API surface presents them as a unified item. The `get_name` property strips the internal `__COLOR` suffix for clean display output. Product images are stored on **Cloudinary** and served with automatic format negotiation and quality optimization via `fetch_format="auto", quality="auto"`.

```python
# Generated field for total price — computed and persisted at DB level
price = models.GeneratedField(
    expression=F("unit_price") * F("quantity"),
    output_field=models.DecimalField(...),
    db_persist=True,
)
```

`OrderItem.price` is a **Django GeneratedField** — computed entirely in the database and persisted, meaning no Python-level arithmetic for total calculations and full indexability.

#### Order System

Orders follow a clean normalized structure: `Order → OrderItem → Product`. Stock deduction happens atomically via `bulk_update` inside a `@transaction.atomic` block. If any stock constraint fails, an `IntegrityError` is caught and surfaced as a user-facing validation error — preventing partial checkouts.

The `actual_price` property on `Product` returns `sale_price or original_price`, ensuring that price-at-purchase is always snapshotted into `OrderItem.unit_price`, guarding against future price changes affecting historical orders.

---

### REST API

Built with **Django REST Framework**

**Key endpoints:**

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/market/products/` | Paginated product list with full filter suite |
| `GET` | `/market/products/{id}/` | Product detail with color switching |
| `POST` | `/market/products/{id}/upload_image/` | Multi-image upload to Cloudinary (admin) |
| `GET/POST` | `/market/orders/` | User orders (authenticated) |
| `GET/POST` | `/market/signboards/` | Hero banner management |
| `GET/POST` | `/market/series/` | Product series management |
| `POST` | `/user/register/` | Registration with immediate JWT issuance |
| `POST` | `/user/login/` | JWT login |
| `POST` | `/user/refresh/` | Token refresh |
| `GET/PATCH` | `/user/me/` | Profile management |
| `POST` | `/payments/webhook/` | Stripe webhook receiver |
| `POST` | `/analytics/events/` | Behavioral event collection |

#### Product Filtering

The `ProductViewSet` implements a comprehensive client-driven filter pipeline entirely in Python/ORM — no raw SQL:

- **Text search** — `name__icontains` with whitespace stripping
- **Availability filter** — `status=true/false` maps to `stock_quantity__gt=0` or `stock_quantity__exact=0`
- **Price range** — `price_lte` / `price_gte` applied against an `annotated` `current_price` field (`Coalesce(sale_price, original_price)`)
- **Color grouping** — colors map through a `color_variables` dict, allowing abstract color names (e.g. "red") to match multiple CSS3 variants
- **Series regex filter** — builds an `iregex` OR-pattern dynamically from a comma-separated list
- **Category multi-select** — comma-separated categories mapped to `category__in`
- **Ordering** — safe whitelist: `current_price` and `name` only, with optional descending prefix

Home page behavior differs deliberately: when no filter params are present, the API returns up to 8 products per category sampled with `order_by("?")`, producing a varied landing page without extra endpoints.

#### Color-Aware Product Detail

```python
# Switching product color via query param: GET /market/products/42/?color=blue
base_name_subquery = (
    Product.objects.filter(**local_kwargs)
    .annotate(base_name=Left("name", StrIndex("name", Value("__")) - 1))
    .values("base_name")[:1]
)
return get_object(
    obj_, name=Concat(base_name_subquery, Value(f"__{color.upper()}"))
)
```

Switching product color is handled entirely in the ORM — extracting the base name via `Left` + `StrIndex`, then reconstructing the color-suffixed name in a single optimized lookup.

#### Custom Pagination

`SimplifiedCustomPagination` uses a strict allowlist (`4`, `8`, `16`, `32`) for `perPage`, preventing abuse from arbitrary page sizes. Pagination is **conditionally activated** — the home page view bypasses it entirely, returning the curated multi-category preview set.

---

### Authentication & Security

- **JWT via SimpleJWT** — 30-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
- **Custom User model** (`user.User`) extends `AbstractUser`, uses **email as the primary identifier** (`USERNAME_FIELD = "email"`) with a separate `username` field retained for display
- **Global permission class** `IsAdminOrReadOnly` — all write operations require staff status; all read operations are public by default
- **HTTPS enforcement** in production: `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`, and `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` are all enabled
- **CORS** is strictly scoped to `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` from environment — no wildcard origins
- **Environment variable validation at startup** — `prod_settings.py` iterates over all required env keys and raises `EnvironmentError` immediately if any are absent, preventing silent misconfigurations from reaching production
- **Image upload validation** — file type and 10 MB size limit enforced at both serializer and view levels, with explicit `isinstance` checks against Django's upload classes
- **Stripe webhook signature verification** — every incoming webhook is verified with `stripe.Webhook.construct_event()` using the secret key; invalid signatures return `HTTP 403`

---

### Payments (Stripe Integration)

The payment flow is fully webhook-driven, making it robust against network failures and client-side manipulation:

1. **Order creation** atomically deducts stock and creates `OrderItem` rows
2. `create_stripe_session()` creates a Stripe Checkout Session and stores the session URL + ID in a `Payment` record (status: `UNPAID`)
3. The client is returned the `payment_url` immediately in the order response
4. Stripe calls `/payments/webhook/` on payment events:
   - `checkout.session.completed` → sets `Payment.status = PAID`
   - `charge.succeeded` → stores the receipt URL
   - `checkout.session.expired` → sets `CANCELED` and triggers `_order_rollback()`, which restores stock quantities via `bulk_update`

The rollback is implemented as a generator feeding `Product.objects.bulk_update()` — a single DB round-trip regardless of cart size.

A 20-minute cooldown guard on payment updates (`UPDATE_PAYMENT_MINUTES = 20`) prevents session refresh abuse.

---

### Analytics Engine

TechMarket includes a **custom-built analytics system**, avoiding third-party tracking dependencies:

#### Session Fingerprinting (Middleware)

`TechMarketSessionParametersMiddleware` runs after successful auth responses (`/user/login/`, `/user/register/`, `/user/refresh/`) and creates a `SessionParameters` record per session:

- **Device type** — Bot / Mobile / Tablet / Desktop (via `user-agents`)
- **Browser** — Chrome / Safari / Edge / Firefox / Other
- **Geography** — continent + country code via IP geolocation (`ip-api.com`), using `django-ipware` for reliable IP extraction behind proxies
- **Access token** — the current JWT is stored as the session identifier, linking events back to their session

Bot sessions are automatically excluded.

#### Event Tracking

The `Event` model captures granular behavioral events tied to a session:

| Event Type | Data Captured |
|---|---|
| `PAGE_VIEW` | Page path |
| `VIEW_ITEM` | Page path |
| `VIEW_SEARCH_RESULTS` | Search term |
| `ADD_TO_CART` | Product name |
| `VIEW_ITEM_LIST` | List name |
| `SELECT_ITEM` | Product name |
| `BEGIN_CHECKOUT` | — |
| `PURCHASE` | — |
| `FIRST_VISIT` | — |

The frontend sends these events to `/analytics/events/` using an authenticated `authFetch` wrapper, mirroring Google Analytics 4's event model in a self-hosted, privacy-friendly way.

---

### Performance & Optimization

- **`select_related` + `prefetch_related`** used consistently across all querysets — `Product` always eagerly loads `series` and `images` to eliminate N+1 queries
- **`bulk_create` / `bulk_update`** for all multi-row operations (order items, stock deduction, rollbacks)
- **`CachedPrimaryKeyRelatedField`** — a custom DRF field that pre-fetches all products referenced in an order payload in a single query before validation, eliminating per-item DB lookups during order creation
- **`_products_cache`** injected at `to_internal_value` level in `OrderSerializer`, making the product resolution O(1) per item after the initial batch fetch
- **Cloudinary auto-optimization** — all images are served with `fetch_format=auto` (WebP/AVIF where supported) and `quality=auto`, reducing bandwidth without storing multiple variants
- **WhiteNoise** with `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage` for hashed, gzip-compressed static file serving without a CDN dependency
- **Database connection pooling** via `conn_max_age=360` in `dj_database_url` — persistent connections across requests
- **`GeneratedField` for `OrderItem.price`** — total price is materialized in the database, not computed in application code

---

### Deployment & Containerization

The backend runs in a minimal **Alpine-based Docker container** (`python:3.14-alpine`) with a dedicated non-root user (`tech_user`) for process isolation:

```dockerfile
RUN addgroup -S django && adduser -S -G django tech_user
...
USER tech_user
```

`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` and `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` are set to ensure clean log streaming and no `.pyc` file generation in the container. Production settings are isolated in `prod_settings.py` and selected via `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` in the image environment — never mixed with local dev settings.

The `build.sh` script handles migrations and Gunicorn startup, both within the same entrypoint, ensuring the schema is always current on deploy.

---

## 🎨 Frontend

### UI & Components

The frontend is a **React 19 SPA** built with **Vite 7**, organized with a clear separation between page-level modules (`/modules`) and reusable feature components (`/components`).

**Page routes:**

| Path | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `HomePage` | Curated product grid + hero carousel |
| `/catalog` | `CatalogPage` | Filtered product listing |
| `/products/:id` | `ProductDetailsPage` | Detail view with color switcher |
| `/cart` | `CartPage` | Cart summary + checkout trigger |
| `/login` | `LoginPage` | JWT login form |
| `/register` | `RegisterPage` | Registration with avatar upload |
| `/orders` | `SuccessOrdersPage` | Order history |
| `/about` | `AboutUsPage` | Team info |
| `/*` | `PageNotFound` | 404 handler |

The design system is built on **shadcn/ui** components (Accordion, Carousel, Button) backed by **Radix UI** primitives for accessibility, with **Tailwind CSS 4** for utility-first styling. **Swiper** drives the hero banner carousel. **Lucide React** and **FontAwesome 7** handle iconography. **Poppins** (Bold, Medium, Light) is self-hosted via `/public/fonts` for zero font-flash.

**Notable components:**

- `ProductsList` — renders the filtered catalog with pagination controls
- `ProductDetails` — full product view with image gallery, color selector, stock badge, characteristics table, and add-to-cart
- `Header` — handles search, cart badge counter, user avatar + auth state, navigation
- `CartPage` — full cart management using Redux-persisted state
- `SuccessOrders` — order history with payment status display, receipt links, and item breakdown
- `StarRating` — visual rating component
- `Breadcrumbs` — contextual navigation trail

---

### State Management

Cart state is managed with **Redux Toolkit**, persisted to `localStorage` so the cart survives page refreshes and browser restarts. The store is initialized from the serialized state on load via a `loadState` / `saveState` pattern using `store.subscribe`.

```typescript
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { cart: cartSlice },
  preloadedState: { cart: loadState() },
});
store.subscribe(() => saveState(store.getState().cart));
```

Auth tokens (JWT access + refresh) are stored in `localStorage` and managed through dedicated utility functions in `src/utils/auth.ts`.

---

### API Integration

**`authFetch`** — a thin wrapper around `fetch` that automatically injects the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for authenticated requests, removing boilerplate from all protected API calls.

**`httpClient.ts`** — a typed generic HTTP utility (`getData<T>` / `postData<T>`) for public endpoints.

**Service layer** (`/services`) contains typed API call functions per domain: product listing, product detail, pagination, signboards, search.

**Analytics integration** — `analyticsEvent()` in `src/utils/analytics.ts` fires event payloads to the backend analytics endpoint after each meaningful user interaction (page views, item selections, cart additions, checkout initiation).

**Token refresh** — `refreshToken()` handles silent re-authentication using the stored refresh token, maintaining session continuity without forcing re-login.

The `category.ts` and `categoryToSlug.ts` utilities handle bidirectional mapping between the backend's category enum values and URL-friendly slugs used for routing.
